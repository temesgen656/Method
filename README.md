# Method
I build a methods that print a inspiration word, A method that returns the average of two integers passed as parameters. The method should return a double so that an accurate average can be communicated,  A method that returns the number of lower case characters in a string passed as a parameter and  A method that returns whether or not a string, passed as a parameter, passes ALL of the tests below.  The string must be at least 8 characters The string must not contain the word password in any case The string must contain at least 2 numbers. The string must not end with a number.
